# Zapstore Webapp — Vision

## What Zapstore Webapp Is

Zapstore Webapp is a fast, SEO-friendly, local-first web interface for the
Zapstore app distribution network built on Nostr.

It enables discovering apps, viewing detailed metadata, and connecting users
to the Zapstore mobile app for installation.

## Who It Is For

- Users discovering apps via search engines or shared links
- Developers checking how their apps appear in the catalog
- Communities sharing and discussing Nostr-native software
- Anyone browsing the Zapstore catalog without installing the mobile app
